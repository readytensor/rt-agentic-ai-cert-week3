# Week 3 Preview: Your RAG Assistant Toolkit

Welcome to Week 3! This week, we‚Äôre going to move beyond theory and start putting the pieces together.

--DIVIDER--

# üìù What‚Äôs in store this week?

You‚Äôll learn how to:

‚úÖ Make your first LLM calls and get comfortable with Groq and LangChain
‚úÖ Use system prompts to shape your assistant‚Äôs style and responses
‚úÖ Manage conversation memory for longer interactions
‚úÖ Bring in **retrieval** to select the most relevant parts of a publication using vector databases like Chroma
‚úÖ Keep your system safe, secure, and robust
‚úÖ Explore best practices for optimizing and scaling your assistant

# üõ†Ô∏è Our running example

Throughout these lessons, we'll anchor our examples in a **practical scenario**:

> Building an assistant that can answer questions about a research publication ‚Äî think "What's the main contribution?" or "How does this methodology work?" or "Can you explain this result?"

We'll use a publication about **Variational Autoencoders** as our test case. This gives us rich technical content to work with and multiple types of questions to handle.

# üß† The progression

Here's how we'll build up your skills:

**Lesson 1**: Start simple ‚Äî basic LLM calls
**Lesson 2**: Craft system prompts
**Lesson 3a**: Manage chat memory
**Lesson 3b**: Persist conversation memory  
 **Lesson 4**: Bring in a vector database and RAG to handle large knowledge bases

# üöÄ What you'll be able to build?

By the end of this week, you'll have **a complete toolkit** of essential techniques, best practices, and real-world patterns that you can use to build your own assistants for publication Q&A, customer support, or any domain you care about.

Let's get started!
